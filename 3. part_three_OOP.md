# 0. Introductory Notes about Java OOP

## General

- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
- Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
- `"Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY)` principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

# 1. Classes & Objects

## Quick notes

- A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

## Creating a Class

- Example
  ```
  public class Main {
    int x = 5;
  }
  ```

## Creating an Object

- Example

  ```
  public class Main {
    int x = 5;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main myObj = new Main();
      // Main --> same as name of class
      // myObj --> name of new object
      // new Main() --> method create new object
      System.out.println(myObj.x)
    }
  }
  ```

## Creating Multiple Objects

- Example

  ```
    public class Main {
      int x = 5;

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        Main firstObj = new Main(); // object 1
        Main secondObj = new Main(); // object 2
        System.out.println(myObj.x)
      }
    }
  ```

## Using Multiple Classes

- Example

  `Main.java`

  ```
  public class Main {
    int x = 5;
  }
  ```

  `Second.java`

  ```
  class Second {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main myObj = new Main();
      System.out.println(myObj.x)
    }
  }
  ```

- After compiling both files and running the second file, you will get `5`

<br>

# 2. Class Attributes

## General

- Class attributes are variables within a class
- Example
  ```
  public class Main {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;
  }
  ```

## Accessing attributes of a class

- Example

  ```
  public class Main {
    int x = 5;

    public static void main(String args[]) {
      Main myObj = new Main(); // Creating the object
      System.out.println(myObj.x); // Accessing & printing out the object
    }
  }
  ```

## Modifying attribute values:

- Example

  ```
  public class Main {
    int x = 5;

    public static void main(String args[]) {
      Main myObj = new Main(); // Creating the object
      myObj.x = 50; // Modifying the attribute
      System.out.println(myObj.x);
    }
  }
  ```

- Declaring a constant variable:
  ```
  final int x = 10;
  ```
- `final` keyword is called a modifier

- If you create multiple objects of one class, you can change the attribute values in one object, without affecting the attribute values in the other

  ```
  public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj1 = new Main();  // Object 1
    Main myObj2 = new Main();  // Object 2
    myObj2.x = 25;
    System.out.println(myObj1.x);  // Outputs 5
    System.out.println(myObj2.x);  // Outputs 25
  }
  }
  ```

# 3. Class Methods

## Quick Notes

- Methods are declared within a class, and that they are used to perform certain actions
- Java programs that have either `static` or `public` attributes and methods

## Static vs Public Methods

- `static` method can be accessed without creating an object of the class
- `public` method can only be accessed by objects
- Example

  ```
  public class Main() {

    // Static method
    static void myStaticMethod() = {
      System.out.println("Static")
    }

    // Public method
    public void myPublicMethod() = {
      System.out.println("Public")
    }

    // Main method
    public staticvoid main(String[] args) {
      myStaticMethod();

    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of main
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Calling the public method of the object
    }
  }
  ```

## Using methods

- Example

  ```
  public class Main() {
    public void fullThrottle() {
      System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
    }
    public void speed(int maxspeed) {
      System.out.println("The car's max speed is: " + maxspeed);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main myCar = new Main();
      myCar.fullThrottle();
      myCar.speed(15);
    }
  }
  ```

## Using multiple classes

- Example

  `Main.java`

  ```
  public class Main {
    public void fullThrottle() {
      System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
    }
    public void speed(int maxspeed) {
      System.out.println("The car's max speed is: " + maxspeed);
    }
  }
  ```

  `Second.java`

  ```
  class Second {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main myCar = new Main();     // Create a myCar obj`ect
      myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method
      myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() met`hod
    }
  }
  ```

<br>

# 4. Constructors

## Notes

- Constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects
- A constructor is called when an object of a class is created
- It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:
- Example

  ```
  public class Main {
    int x;  // Create a class attribute

    // Create a class constructor for the Main class
    public Main() {
      x = 5;  // Set the initial value for the class attribute x
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of class Main (This will call the constructor)
      System.out.println(myObj.x); // Print the value of x
    }
  }
  ```

- Constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void)
- All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.

## Constructor parameters

- Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialise attributes.
- Example

  ```
    public class Main {
      int x;

      public Main (int y) {
        x = y;
      }

      public static void main(String args[]) {
        Main myObj = new Main(5);
        System.out.println(myObj.x);
      }
    }
  ```

<br>

# 5. Modifiers

## Notes

- The `public` keyword is an acesss modifier, meaning that it is used to set up the acesss level for `classes`, `attributes`, `methods` and `constructors`.
- Modifiers can be divided into two groups:
  - access modifiers - controls the access level
  - non-access modifiers - do not control the access level, but provide other functionality

## Access modifiers for classes

- `public` - class is acessible by other classes
- `default` - class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when a modifier is not specified.

## Access modifiers for attributes, methods, and constructors

- `public` - code is accessible for all classes
- `private` - code is only accessible within the declare class
- `default` - class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when a modifier is not specified.
- `protected` - code is only accessible in the same package and subclasses.

## Non-access modifiers for classes

- `final` - class cannot be inherited by other classes
- `abstract` - class cannot be used to create objects (to access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class)

## Non-access modifiers for attributes, methods, and constructors

- `final` - attributes and methods cannot be overidden/ modifiers
- `static` - attributes and methods belong to the class, rather than the object (no need to create object to access static methods, constructors and attributes of this class)
- `abstract` - can only be used in abstract class and on methods. This method does not have a body, for example `abstract void run();`. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited form).
- `transient` - attributes and objects are skipped when serialising the object containing them
- `synchronized` - methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
- `volatile` - the value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"

## Abstract class example

- Example

  - `Main.java`

    ```
    // Abstract class
    abstract class Main {
      public String fname = "John";
      public int age = 24;
      public abstract void study(); // Abstract method
    }

    class Student extends Main {
      public int graduationYear = 2023;
      public void study() {
        System.out.println("Studying all day long");
      }
    }
    ```

  - `Second.java`

    ```
    class Second {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        // create an object of the Student class (which inherits attributes and methods from Main)
        Student myObj = new Student();

        System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.fname);
        System.out.println("Age: " + myObj.age);
        System.out.println("Graduation year: " + myObj.graduationYear);
        myObj.study();
      }
    }
    ```

<br>

# 6. Encapsulation

## Notes

- The meaning of **Encapsulation**, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:
  1. declare class variable/ attributes as `private`
  2. provide public `get` and `set` methods to access and update the value of a `private` variable

## Get and Set

- `private` variables can only be accessed within the same class. The only way to accessed them from outside is through public `get` and `set` methods.
- the `get` method returns the variable value, and the `set` method sets the value
- Example

  ```
  public class Person {
    private String name;

    // Getter
    public String getName {
      return name
    }

    // Setter
    public String setName(String newName) {
      this.name = newName
    }
  }
  ```

- the `get` method returns the value of the variable `name`
- the `set` method returns a parameter (`newName`) and assigns it to the `name` variable.
- `this` keyword is used to refer to the current object

## Why encapsulation?

- Better control of the class attributes and methods
- Class attributes can be made are read-only and write-only
- Flexible - programmers can change one part of the code without affecting the other parts
- Increased security of data

# 7. Packages

## Java packages & API

- A package in java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a directory.
- Packages are used to avoid naming conflicts, and to write more maintainable code.
- Packages are divided into two categories:
  - Built in packages: packages from Java API
  - User-defined packagesL packages created by users

## Built-in Packages

- Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment
- The library contains components for managing input, database programming, and more.
- You can choose to import entire packages (containing numerous classes) or just a a sinle class
- The `import` keyword can be used to import a class or package
- Example
  ```
  import package.name.class; // importing a single class
  import package.name.*; // importing the package
  ```

## Import a class

- If you find a class you want to use, for example, the `Scanner` class, which is used to get user input, write the following code:
  ```
  import java.util.Scanner;
  ```
- In the example above, `java.util` is a package, while `Scanner` is a class within the package
- To use the `scanner` class, just create an object of the class and you can start using its methods
- Example

  ```
  import java.util.Scanner;

  class MyClass {
    public static void (String[] args) {
      Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.println("Enter username: ")l

      String userName = myObj.nextLine();
      System.out.println("Username is: " + username);
    }
  }
  ```

## Import a package

- To create your own package, you need to understand that Java uses a file directory system to store them (like folders on your computer)

  ```
  └── root
      └── mypack
        └── MyPackageClass.java
  ```

- To create a package, use the `package` keyword:
  `MyPackageClass.java`
  ```
  package mypack;
  class MyPackageClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("This is my package!");
    }
  }
  ```
- Save the file as `MyPackageClass.java` and compile it
  ```
  $ javac MyPackageClass.java
  ```
- Then compile the package
  ```
  $ javac -d . MyPackageClass.java
  ```
- This forces the compiler to create the "mypack" package.
- The `-d` keyword specifies where to save the class file.
- Run the package using the following:
  ```
  $ java mypack.MyPackageClass
  ```

## Conventions

- Note that the package name should be written in lowercase to prevent conflict with the class name.
- You can use any directory name like `c:/user` (for windows) after `-d` or you can keep the package in the same directory using the `.` notation.

<br>

# 8. Inheritance

## Notes

- In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
  - subclass (child) - the class that inherit from another class
  - superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
- To inherit from a class, use the `extend` keyword
- Example

  ```
  class Vehicle {
    protected String brand = "Ford";
    public void honk() {
      System.out.println("Honk honk!");
    }
  }

  class Car extends Vehicle {
    private String modelName = "Mustang";
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Create a myCar Object
      Car myCar = new Car();

      // Call the honk() method on the myCar object
      myCar.honk();

      // Display the brand attribute from the vehicle class
      System.out.println("Brand: " + myCar.brand)
    }
  }
  ```

## Final

- `final` keyword can be used to prevent other classes from a class
- Example

  ```
  final class Vehicle {
    // code block
  }
  class Car extends Vehicle {
    // code block
  }
  ```

- If you try to access a `final` class, Java will throw an error

<br>

# 9. Polymorphism

## Notes

- Polymorphism is the use of inherited methods to perform different tasks, allowing a single action to be performed in different ways
- Example

  ```
  class Animal {
    public void animalSound() {
      System.out.println("This animal makes a sound!");
    }
  }

  class Pig extends Animal {
    public void animalSound() {
      System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
    }
  }

  class Dog extends Animal {
    public void animalSound() {
      System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
    }
  }

  class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
      Animal myPig = new Pig();
      Animal myDog = new Dog();
      myAnimal.animalSound();
      myPig.animalSound();
      myDog.animalSound();
    }
  }

  ```

<br>

# 10. Inner Classes

## Notes

- In Java, it is also possible to nest classes (a class within a class).
- The purpose of nested classes is to group classes that belong together, making your code more readable and accessible.
- The advantage of having inner classes is that they can access the attributes and methods of the outer class.
- Example

  ```
  class OuterClass {
    int x = 10;

    class InnerClass {
      int y = 5;
    }
  }

  public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
      OuterClass myouter = new myouterClass();
      OuterClass.InnerClass myInner = myOuter.new.InnerClass();
      System.out.println(myInner.y + myOuter.x);
    }
  }

  // Outputs 15
  ```

## Private Inner Class

- If we don't want outside objects to access the inner class, declare it as `private`
- Example

  ```
  class OuterClass {
    int x = 10;

    private class InnerClass {
      int y = 5;
    }
  }

  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      OuterClass myOuter = new OuterClass();
      OuterClass.InnerClass myInner = new InnerClass();
      System.out.println(myInner.y + myOutter.x);
    }
  }
  ```

# Static Inner Class

- An inner class can also be `static`, meaning it is accessible without creating an object of the outer class
- Example

  ```
  class OuterClass {
    int x = 10;

    class InnerClass {
      int y = 5;
    }
  }

  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      OuterClass.InnerClass myInner = new OuterClass.InnerClass();
      System.out.println(myInner.y);
    }
  }

  // Outputs 5
  ```
