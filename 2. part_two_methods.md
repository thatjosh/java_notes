# 0. Introductory Notes about Java Methods

## General

- a Java method is a block of code which only runs when it is called
- also known as function

## Creating a method

- Example
  ```
  public class Main {
    static void myMethod() {
      // code
    }
  }
  ```
- `myMethod()` is the name of the method
- static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class
- void means that this method does not have a return value

## Calling a method

- Example

  ```
  public class Main {
    static void myMethod() {
      System.out.printIn("Hello, World!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      myMethod();
    }
  }
  ```

- The above outputs `Hello, World!`

# 1. Method Parameters

## Parameters and Arguments

- Information can be passed to methods as parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the method.

- Parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.

- The following example has a method that takes a `String` called `fname` as `parameter`.

  ```
  public class Main {
    static void myMethod(String fname) {
      System.out.println(fname + " Refsnes");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      myMethod("Liam");
      myMethod("Jenny");
      myMethod("Anja");
    }
  }
  ```

  - Taking multiple parameters

    ```
    static void myMethod(String fname, int age) {
      System.out.println(fname + " is " + age);
    }
    ```

  - Return values
    ```
    static int myMethod(int x) {
      return 5 + x;
    }
    ```

# 2. Method Overloading

- With method overloading, multiple methods can have the same name with different parameters:
  ```
  int myMethod(int x)
  float myMethod(float x)
  double myMethod(double x, double y)
  ```

<br>

# 3. Scope

## Normal Scope

- In Java, variables are only accessible inside the region they are created.

  ```
  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

      // Code here CANNOT use x

      int x = 100;

      // Code here can use x
      System.out.println(x);
    }
  }
  ```

## Block Scope

- A block of code refers to all of the code between curly braces `{}`.
- Variables declared inside blocks of code are only accessible by the code between the curly braces, which follows the line in which the variable was declared

  ```
  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

      // Code here CANNOT use x

      { // This is a block

        // Code here CANNOT use x

        int x = 100;

        // Code here **CAN** use x
        System.out.println(x);

    } // The block ends here

    // Code here CANNOT use x

    }
  }
  ```
