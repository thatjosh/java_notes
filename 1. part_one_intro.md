# 0. Introductory Notes about Java

## General

- Java is case-sensitive: `MyClass` and `myclass` has different meaning
- each code statement must end with a semicolon `;`
- When you are working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks `""`

## Comments

- Single-line comments start with two forward slashes `//`
- Multi-line comments start with `/*` and ends with `*/`

<br>

# 1. Compiling & Running Java Code

- `javac [CLASS_NAME].java` compile class file
- `java [CLASS_NAME]` run code for file
- Name of the java file must match the class name
- Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a `class`.

<br>

# 2. Java Classes & Methods

## General methods

- `System` is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output".
- `main()` method is required and you will see it in every Java program.
- `println()` is a method for printing text with a new line at the end.
- `print()` is a method for printing text without a new line at the end.

## String Methods

- `length()` is a method for getting the length of a `String`. (Note: A String in Java is actually an object, which contain methods that can perform certain operations on strings.)
- `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()`
- `indexOf()` method returns the index (the position) of the first occurrence of a specified text in a string (including whitespace) (Note: Java starts counting from 0)
- `concat()` method can be used concatenate two strings

  ```
    firstName.concat(lastName)
  ```

<br>

# 3. Variables & Declaration

## Notes

- All Java variables must be identified with unique names.
- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- Names must begin with a letter
- Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
- Names can also begin with `$` and `\`
- Names are case sensitive
- Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as `int` or `boolean`) cannot be used as names
- Camel casing is the preferred way of naming variables in Java

## Syntax <br>

- `type variableName = value;`

<br>

# 4. Data Types

## General

- `String` - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes (Note: `String` is capitalised
- `int` - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals
- `float` - stores floating point numbers, with decimals
- `char` - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
- `boolean` - stores values with two states: true or false

## Integer Types

- `byte` data type can store whole numbers from -128 to 127
- `short` data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767
- `int` data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647
- `long` data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
- `float` and `double` data types can store fractional numbers. Note that you should end the value with an "f" for floats and "d" for doubles
- `float` data type

  ```
  float myNum = 5.75f;
  System.out.println(myNum);
  ```

- `double` data type
  ```
  double myNum = 19.99d;
  System.out.println(myNum);
  ```

## Char & String

- `char` data type is used to store a single character
- they must be surrounded by single quotes `'`.
  ```
  char myGrade = 'B';
  System.out.println(myGrade);
  ```
- you can `char` to display ASCII characters

  - Input
    ```
    char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
    System.out.print(myVar1);
    System.out.print(myVar2);
    System.out.print(myVar3);
    ```
  - Output
    ```
    ABC
    ```

- `String` data type is used to store a sequence of characters (text). String values must be surrounded by double quotes `""`.

<br>

# 5. Non-Primitive Data Types

- Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

- Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
- Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
- A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
- A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
- The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
- Examples of non-primitive types are `Strings`, `Arrays`, `Classes`, `Interface`, etc.

<br>

# 6. Java Type Casting

## Widening

- Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
  `byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double`
- Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type
  ```
  int myInt = 9;
  double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double
  ```

## Narrowing

- Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type

  `double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte`

- ```
  double myDouble = 9.78d;
  int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int
  ```

<br>

# 7. Key Operators

## Advance

- `++` for increment (similar to C but it's `++x` instead of `x++`)
- `--` for increment (similar to C but it's `--x` instead of `x--`)
- `+=` for additional assignment; all basic operators has an assignment operator

## Basic

- `+` for addition
- `-` for subtraction
- `*` for multiplication
- `/` for division
- `%` for modulus (returns remainder)
- `^` for exponent

## Comparison

- `==` for equal to
- `!=` for not equal to
- `>` for greater than
- `<` for less than
- `>=` for greater than & equal to
- `<=` for less than & equal to

## Logic

- `&&` for `AND`
- `||` for `OR`
- `!` for `NOT`

<br>

# 8. More on Strings & Numbers

## Note

- If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation

  ```
  String x = "10";
  int y = 20;
  String z = x + y;  // z will be 1020 (a String)
  ```

- Escape characters:

  - `\'` for a single quote
  - `\"` for a Double quote
  - `\\` for a Backslash
  - `\n` for new line
  - `\r` for carriage return
  - `\t` for tab
  - `\b` for backspace

<br>

# 9. Math Class

## Note

- The Java Math class has many methods that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

- `Math.max(x,y)` method can be used to find the highest value of x and y
- `Math.min(x,y)` method can be used to find the lowest value of x and y
- `Math.abs(x)` method returns the absolute (positive) value of x
- `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0.0 (inclusive), and 1.0 (exclusive)

# 10. Conditionals & loops

- `if`

  ```
  if (condition) {
    // code block
  }
  ```

- `if... else if ... else...`

  ```
  if (condition 1) {
    // code block

  } else if (condition 2) {
    // code block

  } else {
    // code block

  }
  ```

- Switch statement

  ```
  switch(expression) {
    case x:
      // code block
      break;
    case y:
      // code block
      break;
    default:
      // code block
  }
  ```

- While loop - checks code before running loop

  ```
  while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
  }
  ```

- Do... while... loop - runs loop then checks code

  ```
  do {
    // code block to be executed
  }
  while (condition);
  ```

- General loop - (Note: same as C)

  ```
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
  ```

- For-each loop

  - Format
    ```
    for (type variableName : arrayName) {
      // code block to be executed
    }
    ```
  - Example
    ```
    String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Toyoto"}
    for (String i : cars) {
      System.out.println(i);
    }
    ```

- `break` statement can also be used to jump out of a loop
  - Example:
    ```
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      if (i == 4) {
        break;
      }
      System.out.println(i);
    }
    ```
- `continue` statement breaks one iteration (in the loop) and continue with the next
  - Example:
    ```
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      if (i == 4) {
        continue;
      }
      System.out.println(i);
    }
    ```

# 11. Arrays

## Looping through Array

- Example 1
  ```
  String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
  for (int i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(cars[i]);
  }
  ```
- Example 2 - for-each loop
  ```
  String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
  for (String i : cars) {
    System.out.println(i);
  }
  ```

## One Dimensional Array

- Example
  ```
  int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
  ```
- Access an array like this: `myNum[1]`
- Array index starts from 0
- Uses curly brackets instead of square brackets

## Multi Dimensional Array

- Example
  ```
  int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };
  int x = myNumbers[1][2];
  System.out.println(x); // Outputs 7
  ```
